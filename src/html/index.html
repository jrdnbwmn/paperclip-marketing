<p>We were fifteen by then, already into our last year at the school. We'd been in the pavilion getting ready for a game of <span class="mark">**</span><span class="bold">rounders</span><span class="mark">**</span>. The boys were going <span class="mark">*</span><span class="italic">through</span><span class="mark">*</span> a phase of "enjoying" rounders in order to flirt with us, so there were over thirty of us that afternoon. The <span class="mark">~</span><span class="underline">downpour</span><span class="mark">~</span> had started while we were <span class="mark">~~</span><span class="strikethrough">changing</span><span class="mark">~~</span>, and we found ourselves gathering on the veranda – which was sheltered by the <span class="mark">[</span>pavilion<span class="mark">]</span><span class="l"><span class="link-url">(jrdnbwmn.com)</span></span> roof – while we waited for it to <span class="mark">`</span>stop<span class="mark">`</span>. </p>
